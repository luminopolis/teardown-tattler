teardown-tattler
================

The Teardown Tattler is an application that monitors open city and state data to identify historic properties at risk of being razed.  The main goal of the project is to automate selection of historic properties vs buildings that actually are a nuisance and need to be torn down.  

The Teardown Tattler started as a National Day of Civic Hacking (NDoCH) initiative which occurred on June 1-2 2013 at Union Station in Kansas City.  The project catalyst: the Helzbergs destroyed the Orion building (a historically significant Film Row building at 17th and Wyandotte in Kansas City, MO) without heeding public outcry or opinion.  The immediate next step of the project is to add an advocacy arm via Neighborland or similar.

The original NDoCH hacking team consisted of:
  Briston Davidge (Team Leader)
  Paul Barham<br>
  Shawn Davisson<br>
  David Snodgrass<br>
  Steve Eklund<br>
  Marlene Jeffers<br>
  Mary Jo Draper<br>
  Gatlin Hebert<br>
